## 🧘 UNPOO REDDIT

A lightweight browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that **masks Reddit posts and comments from users active in specific subreddits**, helping you curate your feed for focus, clarity, and peace of mind.

### 🧠 Why?

Reddit is a diverse platform with millions of users and countless communities. While this diversity is a strength, it can sometimes result in exposure to content, drama, or perspectives that are **mentally draining, repetitive, or simply irrelevant** to your interests or values.

This extension exists to help you:

* 🧘‍♂️ Reduce cognitive fatigue from overexposure to certain topics or communities
* 🧼 Maintain a calmer, more focused Reddit browsing experience
* ⚙️ Customize your feed without blocking or reporting other users
* 🕊️ Avoid unproductive discourse and internet arguments

It’s **not about censorship, hate, or exclusion**, but rather about giving yourself the ability to **filter noise** in an open ecosystem.

### 🚀 What It Does

* Scans visible Reddit posts and comments
* Identifies the **authors**
* Checks if they’ve been active in any of the **user-defined “blocked” subreddits**
* If so, **masks** their content with a subtle blur and a warning overlay
* Optional: reveal on hover

Example warning:

> “Masked: user active in blocked subreddit”

### 🔧 Default Blocklist

The extension includes a default list of subreddits commonly associated with high-volume discourse, political polarization, or regional drama (e.g., `r/Chodi`, `r/sipstea`, `r/IndianSocial`, `r/Bangladesh`, etc.).

You are **free to modify** this list to suit your preferences.

### 💡 Philosophy

> *“Your attention is your most precious resource. Spend it wisely.”*

This project is about **content hygiene**, not exclusion. Everyone has the right to speak. You have the right **not to listen** if it harms your mental clarity or well-being.
